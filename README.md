## Hi, I’m Anderson Tegami 👋

Senior Data Analyst with experience turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.  
I focus on defining metrics correctly, building trustworthy analytics, and telling stories that drive decisions.

### What I work with
- **SQL** — complex joins, CTEs, cohort analysis, metric definitions, data validation
- **Tableau** — dashboards focused on clarity, usability, and stakeholder trust
- **Analytics storytelling** — translating ambiguity into decisions, not just charts

### Featured projects
 *(More projects coming soon — SQL, metrics, and dashboard case studies)*
